The Daily Journal is a calming web-based writing experience for anyone looking to reflect, track their emotions, or simply jot down moments from their day. Styled with a pastel aesthetic and dark mode support, it allows you to write, filter, tag with moods, and export your thoughts â€” all stored safely in your browser.
